# JMahjong
 An easy-to-use, extensive Mahjong library for JVM languages
## Motivation
JMahjong is born with the intention to provide an alternative to the most popular Java Japanese Mahjong library [Mahjong4j](https://github.com/mahjong4j/mahjong4j).

The original project has not been updated for 2 years and lack useful functions and English documentation.

This is also a self-use library for my future projects.

## Features
- Score calculation, yaku determination with complete ankan, fuuro and dora support.
- Extensive enough to build custom dora tiles(like 花鳥), custom yakus and even custom scoring.
- All yakus on [riichi.wiki](https://riichi.wiki/List_of_yaku) (except for 流し満貫) are supported
- An ~~not-so-good~~ English documentation and Javadoc
 
## How to use

Please refer to the Github [wiki]()...
## Disadvantages
Well, I hate telling others what we have without telling them what we don't have.
- Author is Chinese. You can expect Chinglish everywhere.
- **No** coverage, **no** standard tests, **not** up-to-standard library building.
- Hard-to-read code style and messy project files.
- Some parts are not elegant enough.
- No building instruction.

## Future Plans
- Shanten Calculation
