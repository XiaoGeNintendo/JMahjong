# JMahjong
[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/6ed43c4d49b54d16af5894212a0795ae)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/XiaoGeNintendo/JMahjong/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=XiaoGeNintendo/JMahjong&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

(Aims to be) an easy-to-use, extensive Mahjong library for JVM languages
## Motivation
JMahjong is born with the intention to provide an alternative to the most popular Java Japanese Mahjong library [Mahjong4j](https://github.com/mahjong4j/mahjong4j).

The original project has not been updated for 2 years and lack useful functions and English documentation.

This is also a self-use library for my future projects.

## Features
- Score calculation, yaku determination with complete ankan, fuuro and dora support.
- Extensive enough to build custom dora tiles(like 花鳥), custom yakus and even custom scoring.
- All yakus on [riichi.wiki](https://riichi.wiki/List_of_yaku) (except for 流し満貫) are supported
- An ~~not-so-good~~ English documentation and Javadoc
 
## Disadvantages
Well, I hate telling others what we have without telling them what we don't have.
- Author is Chinese. You can expect Chinglish everywhere.
- **No** coverage, **no** standard tests, **not** up-to-standard library building.
- Hard-to-read code style and messy project files.
- Some parts are not elegant enough.
- No building instruction.

## How to use

Please refer to the WIP Github [wiki]()...

## Future Plans
- Shanten Calculation
